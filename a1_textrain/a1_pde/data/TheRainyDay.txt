My life is cold, and dark, and dreary; 
It rains, and the wind is never weary; 
My thoughts still cling to the moldering Past, 
But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast, 
And the days are dark and dreary. 
Be still, sad heart! and cease repining; 
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining; 
Thy fate is the common fate of all, 
Into each life some rain must fall, 
Some days must be dark and dreary.
